#NPM wrapper for polymer-elements/core-ajax.

## NOTE:
This is old.  It hasn't been updated in a while, but is used for the
call-log and is stable.  This would get "upgraded" simply by not using
and using polymer-serve.  Would need a bit of work/time/testing.

##Why?
To keep relative npm pathing similar to bower paths so we don't have to
modify the source.

##TODO
* More elements to come later?
